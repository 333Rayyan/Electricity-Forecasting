# ⚡Electricity Load Forecasting

A dissertation project focused on developing and comparing three forecasting models — ARMA, Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) — to predict short-term electricity demand using real-world data from Germany. The project evaluates model accuracy, complexity, and practical use in energy forecasting.

## Features
- Load forecasting using statistical (ARMA), machine learning (KRR), and deep learning (LSTM) models.
- Evaluation using MAPE, MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
- Detailed zoomed-in analysis of performance over 3–7 June 2019.
- Comparison against official ENTSO-E forecast data.
- Visualisation of predictions and error metrics.
- Structured and consistent experimental design.
